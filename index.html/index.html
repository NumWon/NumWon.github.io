                <h4>Matching Cards Game</h4>
                <h5>Swift/Obj-C</h5>
                <p>This was a commonly played card game that I decided to develop as I started to learn iOS development. It's a fun little solo game where a player has 8 pairs of flipped over cards in which they have a specific amount of time to flip 2 cards at a time and match all 8 pairs of cards.</p>

                <h4>Waterloo Housing Website</h4>
                <h5>HTML/CSS/JS</h5>
                <p>During June 2021, I partook in the EngHack hackathon in which I, along with 3 others, decided to create a website to help new University of Waterloo students easily compare the most popular residences for when in-person activities return. We provided information on each residence's basic ammentiies, distance from campus, top reviews, and more.</p>

                <h4>Minesweeper</h4>
                <h5>C++</h5>
                <p>Developed a consol-based minesweeper game with a user-defined size and number of mines. The user simply types the coordinate and the action they wish to perform, like flag or show the coordinate. It's a rather simple game to play and the efficiently programmed algorithms allow for minimal delays.</p>
